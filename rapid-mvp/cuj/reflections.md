# A1 Team Principles Evaluation: Sprint Reflections

## Conflict Resolution

We used our **"Disagree and Commit"** principle when we disagreed on the timer implementation. Our Technical Lead wanted a single-phase timer, while our Product/UX Lead wanted an automated dual-phase system. We prototyped both approaches using **"Data over Ego"**. The dual-phase timer won because it reduced instructor cognitive load.

When someone requested a scope change mid-sprint (team metadata export), they followed our **"Early Warning"** principle by flagging it during our regular check-in. We used our **"Recovery Plan"** approach: paused to evaluate impact and moved it to a follow-up sprint.

## Accountability & Definition of Done

We followed our **Work Delegation** process. We used **GitHub Projects** to track all tasks, with each item linked to a GitHub Issue that had a clear owner, acceptance criteria, and target date. For example, the team randomizer feature had clear "done" criteria: exclude already-presented teams, display selected team metadata, and reset cleanly.

Everyone completed their tasks, and we enforced our **Definition of Done**. Our PR review process made sure all acceptance criteria were met and documentation was updated before merging.

## Feedback Collection & Action

Feedback collection worked well. We had mid-sprint check-ins and team members shared feedback through our team channel. Everyone followed our communication norms—they @tagged people when needed and used reactions. Team members gave feedback on design and functionality, and we acted on it quickly.

## What Held Up vs. What Broke Down

**What held up:** Our **Communication** norms worked well. We communicated regularly, with team members checking daily and responding quickly. The @tagging system meant questions got answered within hours. When one developer got stuck on the randomization algorithm, they tagged the Technical Lead immediately, and we pair-programmed through it in 45 minutes. Our **"Ship in slices"** value helped—we delivered small increments.

**What broke down:** Nothing major broke down. We followed our **Collaboration rules** by avoiding last-minute merges—all features were done with enough time for proper PR review.

## Acceptance Criteria

Our acceptance criteria worked because they were specific and measurable, as required by our **Work Delegation** process. The timer feature had clear criteria (visual warning at 2 minutes, automatic phase transition) and passed all tests. All GitHub Issues had testable, observable acceptance criteria, which prevented debates during PR review.

Overall, the sprint validated our team principles. Our **"Blameless growth"** culture made everyone comfortable asking questions and flagging concerns early. GitHub Projects, regular communication, and clear accountability structures helped us collaborate smoothly.
