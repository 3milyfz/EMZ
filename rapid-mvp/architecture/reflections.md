# A3 Reflections: How A2 CUJ + Week 2 Feedback Drove Architectural Maturity

A2’s CUJ audit and Week 2 peer feedback changed how we think about architecture: we stopped treating the system as “a UI with working endpoints” and started treating it as an **operational tool** used under time pressure. In A2, our MVP was functionally correct—randomization avoided repeats, team metadata displayed, and the dual-phase timer transitioned. But the CUJ surfaced a gap between *correctness* and *usability*: small frictions (progress ambiguity, timer transition risk, and accessibility issues) created cognitive load at exactly the moments an instructor cannot afford it. Week 2 feedback reinforced that the most important requirement was not more features, but a workflow that stays stable when the instructor is moving quickly.

That insight directly influenced our A3 architecture decisions. First, it reframed our definition of “production-grade persistence.” In A2 we treated persistence as optional; after the CUJ, we recognized that instructors need continuity across refreshes, redeploys, and repeated sessions. This pushed us to formalize a true data layer: a Railway backend with **persistent storage** (SQLite on a mounted volume) accessed through Prisma. Even though the project scale is small, we architected for reliability: state must survive redeploys, and data must remain accessible after class. The most concrete lesson was that *where* initialization runs matters in cloud environments. Our deployment debugging (derived from the CUJ mindset of measuring friction and identifying ground truth) exposed that database initialization during the build phase does not necessarily target persistent storage; we adjusted our deployment flow so schema setup occurs at runtime against the mounted volume. This was our first “architecture upgrade” driven by CUJ thinking: treating persistence as a system guarantee, not a local convenience.

Secondly, CUJ findings changed what we persist and why. The audit showed that instructors are not only managing selection and time—they are producing outcomes (feedback, observations, and timing constraints) that they want to reference later. That requirement drove a deliberate expansion of the data model and API boundaries. We added an **Instructor Notes System** that persists per-team notes and automatically loads them when a team is selected, minimizing context switches during the live session. We also persisted the **presentation and Q&A timing information** and integrated both notes and timing into **CSV exports**, making the data layer useful beyond the moment of presentation. This is an architectural decision as much as a UI feature: it required defining stable persistence, durable export endpoints, and a data plane that can reconstruct session context after the fact.

Lastly, Week 2 feedback and the CUJ lowlights shaped our application/presentation-tier interface to reduce operational risk. The A2 audit identified that awkward phase transitions could silently reduce Q&A time if an instructor spoke between phases. In A3, we refined timer orchestration with **Auto-Start Q&A** on explicit transition to remove an extra click and reduce state ambiguity at the phase boundary. We also improved the team management surface so the presentation tier reflects the instructor’s mental model of the session: a structured team list with remove actions, live highlighting, and clear counters. Finally, we addressed the accessibility feedback by implementing a light theme option, improving legibility in bright classrooms—an example of a non-functional requirement (visibility) becoming a first-class design constraint.

We treated A3 as a shift from shipping an MVP to engineering a system that can be operated reliably. The CUJ framework did not just generate UI tweaks; it drove architectural choices about persistence guarantees, runtime initialization, API boundaries, and what “session state” should mean in a cloud-deployed environment. Week 2 feedback provided the prioritization lens: optimize the instructor loop, reduce cognitive load, and make the system resilient to real classroom pacing.
