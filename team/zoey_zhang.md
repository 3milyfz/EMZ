## About Zoey

Zoey is a data scientist with experience building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) customer-service chatbot at Questrade and identifying credit-card client cross-selling opportunities using LLMs at Wealthsimple. She has also conducted Human–Computer Interaction research at the University of Toronto focused on LLM applications in mental health and education.

She was born in China, lived in Europe, and has work experience in Canada. She learned German during her time in Budapest because Hungarian was just too hard. Her favorite travel destination is Seville, Spain—for the food, weather, and people.

## Strengths

- LLM + data product thinking (evaluation-driven, user-centered)
- Backend/data pipeline instincts (clean data contracts, scalable architecture)
- Strong communication on tradeoffs (turns ambiguous asks into testable plans)

## Weaknesses

- Can over-index on rigorous analysis when a fast “good-enough” prototype would unblock progress
- Less practiced in front-end implementation details and UX-to-production feasibility compromises
- Tends to assume high user literacy unless explicitly checked via user research
