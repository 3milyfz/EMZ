## About Jane
Emily is a full-stack developer with experience leading nonprofit tech initiatives, automating large-scale warehouse workflows at Chick-fil-A Corporate, and building global payroll products at Rippling. Beyond coding and coursework, she loves traveling and explored Portugal, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and Japan in 2025. She’s also an avid reader with a soft spot for romantasy, currently deep into the ACOTAR and Empyrean series, which have completely taken over her free time.

## Strengths

- Full-Stack Design Integration: She bridges the gap between engineering and aesthetics, enabling the rapid creation of professional-grade, user-centric prototypes.
- Agile Problem-Solving: She excels at innovating on the fly and proactively identifying vulnerabilities or pain points within the product’s logic.
- Effective Presentation & Public Speaking: She is a confident communicator who can clearly articulate complex technical concepts and project goals to a wide audience.

## Weaknesses

- Delayed Escalation: She tends to wait until it is too late to ask for assistance, which can create bottlenecks in the development timeline.
- Technical Gap in AI/LLM: She lacks experience in choosing model architectures and managing implementation trade-offs like cost versus latency.
- Susceptibility to Tunnel Vision: She can become overly hyper-focused on specific tasks, potentially losing sight of alternative solutions.
