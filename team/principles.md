# Team Principles
> Applies to the full team across **CSC491 / CSC454** collaboration.

Our team principles exist to make teamwork predictable, respectful, and high-velocity. We assume good intent, prioritize clarity over perfection, and treat mistakes as learning opportunities. We aim for a **positive, cohesive, blameless culture**—we are a team, not just a group.

---

## 1) Roles & Responsibilities
**Core roles (may rotate by sprint):**
- **Project Lead / Facilitator:** sets agendas, keeps decisions moving, ensures owners + deadlines are assigned.
- **Technical Lead:** oversees architecture consistency, code quality standards, and technical risk management.
- **Product / UX Lead:** owns user needs, workflows, UI coherence, and usability/accessibility considerations.
- **QA / Release Owner:** coordinates testing, demo readiness, and release checklists.

**General expectations (everyone):**
- Own your tasks end-to-end (define → implement → test → document → handoff).
- Ask for help early when blocked.
- Respect deadlines and keep the team informed about risk.

## 2) Communication
**Primary channel:** private Slack channel `EMZ`  
**Purpose:** confirm meetings, coordinate work, handle questions, and keep progress visible.

**Norms:**
- The person asking a question should **@tag** the specific people they need.
- General questions can be posted to the whole group.
- Use 👍 / ✅ reactions to acknowledge important answers and decisions.
- Everyone is expected to check Slack **at least once per weekday (Mon–Fri)**.
- If you cannot check Slack for **> 1 day**, inform the team in advance.

**Emergencies:**
- The team will keep a pinned message with **phone numbers** for texting/calling.
- Emergency contact is for rare, time-sensitive cases only (e.g., missed hard deadlines, urgent issues).

**Why these rules exist:** to reduce ambiguity, avoid silent blockers, and keep a supportive and blameless team culture.

---

## 3) Meetings
We will hold **regular meetings** (weekly or as needed), plus short check-ins during critical periods.

**Expectations:**
- Attend meetings whenever possible.
- If you can’t attend, notify the team **as soon as you know**.
- If absent, you must propose a **compensation plan**, e.g.:
  - send an async update before the meeting
  - delegate your discussion items to someone else
  - review meeting notes and confirm understanding of new tasks within 24 hours

**Meeting hygiene:**
- Meetings should end with clear outcomes: decisions made, tasks assigned, and next steps recorded.

---

## 4) Work Delegation & Workflow
**Delegation process:**
- Work is delegated during meetings or async planning.
- Each task must be recorded as a **GitHub Issue** with:
  - owner
  - acceptance criteria / definition of done
  - target date
  - links to relevant docs/designs

**Collaboration rules:**
- Avoid last-minute merges. Tasks should be completed with enough buffer for review.
- Changes should go through **pull requests** (when applicable), with review requests tagged clearly.
- If a task expands or becomes harder than expected, communicate early and renegotiate scope.

**Definition of “done”:**
- Acceptance criteria met
- Basic tests/checks pass (as applicable)
- Documentation updated (README / notes / issue updates)
- Demo-ready if it’s part of a milestone

---

## 5) Accountability & Handling Missed Commitments
We recognize that life happens; we optimize for transparency and recovery.

- **Early Warning:** if you’re likely to miss a deadline, notify the team *when the risk is identified*, not on the due date.
- **Recovery Plan:** propose a revised deadline and/or request specific help to unblock.
- **Blameless Retro:** if missed commitments become a pattern, we run a short retro to adjust scope, workload, or clarity.

---

## 6) Conflict Resolution & Decision-Making
Disagreement is expected and healthy.

- **Disagree and Commit:** debate thoroughly, then commit to the final decision.
- **Data over Ego:** when feasible, run a quick experiment or small prototype instead of looping in debate.
- **Escalation:** if a true deadlock persists, consult a TA or external mentor within 24 hours.

---

## 7) Team Values
- **Clarity beats guesswork:** assumptions must be stated.
- **Respect the user:** accessibility, privacy, and trust are not afterthoughts.
- **Ship in slices:** deliver small, testable increments instead of big unknowns.
- **Blameless growth:** mistakes are signals for process improvement, not blame.
