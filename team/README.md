## Sprint setup and workflow configuration

Our sprint planning and execution are managed in **GitHub Projects (Kanban)**, where each sprint is represented by a scoped set of Issues with clear owners, due dates, and acceptance criteria. We use a simple status flow (e.g., Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done) to make work visible and reduce hidden blockers. Each task is tracked as a GitHub Issue and, when applicable, delivered through a pull request with lightweight review to ensure quality without slowing momentum. If a task is blocked, it is moved to **Blocked** (or labeled) and the owner posts a short update describing what’s needed to unblock. At the end of each sprint, we do a brief retro to note what worked, what didn’t, and what we will change in the next sprint.

## Tooling selection and justification

We will also set up a **separate GitHub repository for application code** to support version control and coordination through branches, pull requests, code reviews, and CI checks. This keeps our Homebase repository focused on documentation and company artifacts while enabling a clean, professional engineering workflow for implementation.

Our **primary communication tool** is our private **team Slack channel**, which we use for daily coordination, quick questions, meeting logistics, and early warnings when deadlines are at risk. Important decisions and action items are summarized in Slack and then recorded in GitHub (Issue comments or PR descriptions) so the repo remains the source of truth.
